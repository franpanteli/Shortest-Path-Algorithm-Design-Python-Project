# Shortest-Path-Algorithm-Design-Python-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the sixth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this ([shortest-path.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Shortest-Path-Algorithm-Design-Python-Project/blob/main/shortest-path.py)), which applied Dijkstra's algorithm, to calculate the shortest distances and paths between nodes on a graph. A graph was first defined for this, in the form of a Python dictionary. Nodes in this were iterated through and Dijkstra's algorithm was applied. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches for this and my project [shortest path algorithm problem solving thought process notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Shortest-Path-Algorithm-Design-Python-Project/blob/main/Shortest%20Path%20Algorithm%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my function-writing skills with Python and marked the successful completion of the sixth project in the certification.
